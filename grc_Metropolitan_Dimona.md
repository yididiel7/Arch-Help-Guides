  2. Representation: Establishing the methods for electing or appointing council members, as well as the rules for determining their terms of office.

  3. Powers and responsibilities: Defining the specific powers and responsibilities delegated to the council, such as land use planning, transportation, environmental protection, and economic development.

  4. Budget and finance: Outlining the process for developing and adopting a budget, including revenue sources, expenditure categories, and budget approval procedures.

  5. Public participation: Encouraging public involvement in council activities and decision-making processes, such as through public meetings, public hearings, and community outreach efforts.

  6. Transparency and accountability: Ensuring transparency and accountability in council operations, including the release of public documents and records, open meetings, and financial reporting.

It is important to note that these guidelines may vary depending on the specific region and local government laws and regulations.
