# Configuring as EDITOR

To use Sublime Text as the editor for many commands that 
prompt for input, set your EDITOR environment variable:

export EDITOR='subl -w'

Specifying -w will cause the subl command to not exit until the file is closed.
# LSD Aliases
alias ls='lsd'
alias l='ls -l'
alias la='ls -a'
alias lla='ls -la'
alias lt='ls --tree'

## This Code command will give you this folder.

To check if the font you are using is setup correctly, try running the following snippet in a shell and see if that prints a folder icon. If it prints a box, or question mark or something else, then you might have some issues in how you setup the font or how your terminal emulator renders the font.

` echo $'\uf115' ` 'ï„•'
