Note that require("discount") returns a single function, which you are responsible for giving a suitable name. Example:

discount = require("discount")

local markdown_string = [[
  # Demonstration
  This is a demonstration of lua-discount. Passing the options `"nolinks"` 
  disables links such as [this](https://asbradbury.org/projects/lua-discount/).
  ]]

  local html_string = discount(markdown_string, "nolinks")

  The discount function takes as its first argument the Markdown string to convert, and for its subsequent arguments takes any combination of the following strings as options:

"nolinks"
    do not allow <a or expand Markdown links.
"noimages"
    do not allow <img or expand Markdown images.
"nopants"
    disable SmartyPants processing.
"nohtml"
    disallow embedded html by replacing all < with &lt;.
"tagtext"
    don't expand * or _ when used for emphasis.
"noext"
    do not process pseudo-protocols
"cdata"
    generate output suitable for use as data in an XML document.
"embed"
    equivalent to specifying "nolinks", "noimages" and "tagtext".
