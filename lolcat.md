Fortune

If you want a good piece of random, interesting advice sent to your terminal, then you should use the fortune command, but it will be much easier to read when you combine it with lolcat.

I like to read random fortunes, and as a result, you can see that I have run the below command multiple times in the following attached image.

$ fortune | lolcat
