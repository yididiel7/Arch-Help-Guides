Emmet

  Emmet plugin installed

  Emmet is a web-developerâ€™s toolkit for boosting HTML & CSS code writing.

  With Emmet, you can type expressions (abbreviations) similar to CSS selectors and convert them into code fragment with a single keystroke. For example, this abbreviation:

  ul#nav>li.item$*4>a{Item $}

  ...can be expanded into:

  <ul id="nav">
      <li class="item1"><a href="">Item 1</a></li>
      <li class="item2"><a href="">Item 2</a></li>
      <li class="item3"><a href="">Item 3</a></li>
      <li class="item4"><a href="">Item 4</a></li>
  </ul>

Origami
-------

  Origami
     the art of folding paper

  https://github.com/SublimeText/Origami

  Origami is a new way of thinking about panes in Sublime Text:
  you tell Sublime Text where you want a new pane, and it makes one for you.
  It works seamlessly alongside the built-in layout commands.

  All commands are available under the View>Origami menu, as well as in the
  command palette (search for Origami).

  Keybindings also exist for most commands. Origami shortcuts start by pressing
  and releasing ctrl+k (or cmd+k), followed by a second shortcut, like this:
   * ctrl/cmd+k, then an arrow: move focus to the pane in that direction
   * ctrl/cmd+k, then shift+arrow: move the current file to the destination
   * ctrl/cmd+k, then alt/option+arrow: clone the current file to the destination
   * ctrl/cmd+k, then ctrl/cmd+arrow: create an adjacent pane
   * ctrl/cmd+k, then ctrl/cmd+shift+arrow: destroy an adjacent pane

  IMPORTANT
  ---------

  Do NOT edit the default SublimeCodeIntel settings. Your changes will be lost
  when SublimeCodeIntel is updated. ALWAYS edit the user SublimeCodeIntel settings
  by selecting "Preferences->Package Settings->SublimeCodeIntel->Settings - User".
  Note that individual settings you include in your user settings will **completely**
  replace the corresponding default setting, so you must provide that setting in its entirety.

auto-save
---------

  Thank you for installing AutoSave
  ----------------------------------------

  You're one step closer to having your files save automatically after every modification!


  Documentation
  =============
  The plugin is dead simple. When turned on, the current file you are viewing will
  save automatically as you modify it. In other words, the file saves after every keystroke.
  The plugin is turned off by default since it is so invasive. You may enable it by adding
  a key binding to the "auto_save" command in "Preferences / Key Bindings - User", for example:

  { "keys": ["ctrl+shift+s"], "command": "auto_save" }

  See links below for more help.
