## Some Advantages and Features of Rsync Command.

It efficiently copies and sync files to or from a remote system.
Supports copying links, devices, owners, groups, and permissions.

It‚Äôs faster than scp (Secure Copy) because rsync uses a remote-update protocol which allows transferring just the differences between two sets of files. 
The first time, it copies the whole content of a file or a directory from source to destination but from next time, it copies only the changed blocks and bytes to the destination.

## Rsync consumes less bandwidth utilization as it uses compression and decompression method while sending and receiving data on both ends.

Some common options used with rsync commands.

 -v : verbose
 -r : copies data recursively (but don‚Äôt preserve timestamps and permission while transferring data).
 -a : archive mode, which allows copying files recursively and it also preserves symbolic links, file permissions, user & group ownerships, and timestamps.
 -z : compress file data.
 -h : human-readable, output numbers in a human-readable format.
