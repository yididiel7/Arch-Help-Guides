Method 9. Tweaks in the advanced configuration

 

The accessible configs menu in Firefox offers many options that can be changed with just one click! Tweak these settings and speed up the browser.

 

    Open Firefox, and type “about:config” in the URL bar. Press Enter to navigate to the advanced configuration page. Click the I'll be careful, I promise button to proceed.
    Make the following changes:
        Set browser.download.animateNotifications to false
        Set security.dialog_enable_delay to 0
        Set network.prefetch-next to false
        Set browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.feeds.telemetry to false
        Set browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.telemetry to false
        Set browser.ping-centre.telemetry to false
        Set toolkit.telemetry.archive.enabled to false
        Set toolkit.telemetry.bhrPing.enabled to false
        Set toolkit.telemetry.enabled to false
        Set toolkit.telemetry.firstShutdownPing.enabled to false
        Set toolkit.telemetry.hybridContent.enabled to false
        Set toolkit.telemetry.newProfilePing.enabled to false
        Set toolkit.telemetry.reportingpolicy.firstRun to false
        Set toolkit.telemetry.shutdownPingSender.enabled to false
        Set toolkit.telemetry.unified to false
        Set toolkit.telemetry.updatePing.enabled to false
    Restart Firefox and check how it compares to before making these adjustments. After making these changes, you should notice Firefox running much smoother.

Method 10. Refresh Firefox

 

If nothing else worked, you can try to reset Firefox entirely to its default configuration without having to reinstall the app. This is going to ensure you’re on factory defaults and no customization is slowing down the browser!

 

    Open Firefox, and then type “about:support” into the address bar. Press the Enter key on your keyboard to be redirected to the support page.
    Look for the Give Firefox a tune up section. Under this, click on the Refresh Firefox button.
    Click Refresh Firefox again in the pop-up prompt to confirm the process, and then wait for the browser to reset to its default state. Afterward, check if it’s still running slow.

 

After resetting Mozilla Firefox, we recommend going back to Method 9 and tweaking the advanced configurations.

sudo apt install libvirt-daemon-system
