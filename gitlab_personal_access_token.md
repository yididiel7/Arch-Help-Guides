## Configure Git

To start using Git from your computer, you must enter your credentials to identify yourself as the author of your work. The full name and email address should match the ones you use in GitLab.

    In your shell, add your full name:

    git config --global user.name "John Doe"

Add your email address:

git config --global user.email "your_email_address@example.com"

To check the configuration, run:

git config --global --list

The --global option tells Git to always use this information for anything you do on your system. If you omit --global or use --local, the configuration applies only to the current repository.

## Add your files

Create or upload files

Add files using the command line or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/yididiel7/my-dotfiles.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main

## To add files to my-dotfiles folder

cd into 

$ cd ~/my-dotfiles

and copy the file that you want to add with this command:

cp ~/readmesample.md . 

then list the contents of this directory with this cmd:

ls -lah

Next we need to delete the original file from our home directory, but we will
just rename it / backit up in the /home/srhills/readmesample.md $HOMEFOLDER like this:

$ mv ~/readmesample.md ~/readmesample.md.bak

You can just DELETE the file with **$ rm ~/readmesample.md** But I don't want to delete the file because it's better to back it up.
