## Record your first session

Make sure you have asciinema recorder installed.

To start recording run the following command in your terminal:

$ asciinema rec -i 2

$ asciinema rec -c lf

$ asciinema rec -t "Pacman -Q Search"

When you're ready to finish just exit the shell, either by typing exit or hitting C-d.

If you have already uploaded a recording but you don't see it here then associate it with your account by running asciinema auth in your terminal.


Just pass asciinema rec a file name as an argument, in which case it will simply save the recording to the local file and not try to upload it to the server. For example:

$ asciinema rec demo.cast

You can then play the recording locally (on the terminal) with:

$ asciinema play demo.cast

And finally upload it with:

$ asciinema upload demo.cast

See the asciinema usage docs for more details on each of these.

You mentioned hosting the recording in your own server. In that case, you might want to look at setting your own asciinema web app instance, which you need to run on your server in order to host screen-casts you upload. That page has a link to the web app install guide (which by default runs in a Docker container.) Once you have that up and running, you can configure your local asciinema to upload to your server rather than the public one in asciinema.org.
```
**Alternatively, you can simply host the asciinema player along with the *.cast files in a web-server and embed them directly into an HTML page, which sounds like you are looking for, as there is no asciinema upload step involved. See these instructions for standalone usage of the asciinema-player app.**
