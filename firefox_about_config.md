3. Essential About:Config Tweaks

You can change intricate settings in Firefox through its accessible Configs menu. We've featured a few essential Firefox tweaks already, but this time, we're going to concentrate only on those that make the browser work faster.
How to Access and Use About:Config

    Open a New Tab
    Type about:config in the URL bar
    Click I'll be careful, I promise
    Search for any string mentioned below
    Double-click value to change the value of any field
    Click anywhere else to save the changes

Once you're in about:config, change the following preferences to the denoted value so that your Firefox runs faster.

    Set browser.download.animateNotifications to False
    Set security.dialog_enable_delay to 0
    Set network.prefetch-next to False (Only on slow internet connections)
    Set browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.feeds.telemetry to false
    Set browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.telemetry to false
    Set browser.ping-centre.telemetry to false
    Set toolkit.telemetry.archive.enabled to false
    Set toolkit.telemetry.bhrPing.enabled to false
    Set toolkit.telemetry.enabled to false
    Set toolkit.telemetry.firstShutdownPing.enabled to false
    Set toolkit.telemetry.hybridContent.enabled to false
    Set toolkit.telemetry.newProfilePing.enabled to false
    Set toolkit.telemetry.reportingpolicy.firstRun to false
    Set toolkit.telemetry.shutdownPingSender.enabled to false
    Set toolkit.telemetry.unified to false
    Set toolkit.telemetry.updatePing.enabled to false

Your Firefox should now be visibly faster, as you have just disabled unnecessary animations, stopped the countdown timer when you're installing extensions, and told it to stop preloading web pages when you're on a slow connection.
