# Recommendations

Dual booting Garuda Linux may lead to unexpected issues! 
Be aware that the other OS may change the EFI boot priorities 
on UEFI or overwrite the bootloader on BIOS systems.
Our distro is optimized for performance on real hardware. 
Installing in virtual machines is not recommended as it 
might result in a bad experience! (e.g. setup assistant not working)

You can follow this video tutorial if you need a more detailed explanation 
for installing Garuda Linux.

Try to avoid using Snapd and Flatpack whenever possible. 
They are considered unsupported.
