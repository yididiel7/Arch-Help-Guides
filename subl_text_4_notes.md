**Linux: scroll bar behavior:**

Linux: System scroll bar overlay settings are now followed
In the new version the scroll bar disappears automatically till one clicks in the miniview on the right side, and if one clicks in the source again it disappears again.
Sorry, this new feature lets despair me. I have to edit a C source containing more then 20,000 LOCs and I’m not allowed to split that monster. Please give me the fixed scroll bar back! Havn’t found a related item in the preferrences. So it’s unknown how to reach this urgent target.

**Simply set the ` "overlay_scroll_bars" setting to "disabled".`**
