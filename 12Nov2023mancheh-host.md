## What is Camel Case?

In camel case, you start a name with a small letter. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with a capital letter:

Here are some examples of camel case: firstName and lastName.
What is Snake Case?

Like in camel case, you start the name with a small letter in snake case. If the name has multiple words, the later words will start with small letters and you use a underscore (_) to separate the words.
Here are some examples of snake case: first_name and last_name.
What is Kebab Case?
Kebab case is similar to snake case, but you use a hyphen (-) instead of an underscore (_) to separate the words.

Here are some examples of kebab case: first-name and last-name.
What is Pascal Case?

Unlike the previous examples, names in pascal case start with a capital letter. In case of the names with multiple words, all words will start with capital letters.

Here are some examples of pascal case: FirstName and LastName.
When to Use Each Naming Convention

Now, based on the language you're working on and what you're naming, the preferred case type can change.

For example, according to the PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code, variable and function names should use snake case:

user_name = 'Farhan'

def reverse_name(name):
	return name[::-1]

Let's take a look at JavaScript now. According to the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, variable and function names should use camel case:

const userName = "Farhan";

function reverseName(name) {
 	return name.split("").reverse().join("");
}

Although Python and JavaScript require you to follow different conventions when you're naming variables and functions, both languages require you to use pascal case when naming a class.
