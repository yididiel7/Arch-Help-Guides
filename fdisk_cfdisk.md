fdisk /dev/sdb

Then, use the mkfs command to format the new partition. 
For example, to format the new partition as ext4, you would run:

mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb1

Finally, use the mount command to mount the new partition. 
For example, to mount the new partition on /mnt, you would run:

mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

✔ You:  … Can you use cfdisk in this example?
