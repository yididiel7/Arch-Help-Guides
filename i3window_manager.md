✔ You:  … Can you decribe i3 window manager?
GPT-3:
Sure! i3 is a tiling window manager designed for X11, which is the default display server on most Unix-like operating systems. Unlike traditional window managers that use a stacking window layout, where windows can be layered on top of each other and interactively resized with the mouse, i3 arranges windows in a tiled layout, where each window has its own container and doesn't overlap with other windows.

The i3 window manager uses a powerful keyboard-driven interface for managing windows, workspaces, application launching and more. This allows users to easily navigate and switch between different windows and workspaces without having to use a mouse.

Here are some key features of i3:

- Tiling layout: All windows are automatically tiled and resized to fill the available screen space.
- Keyboard-driven: Most actions are performed using the keyboard, which makes it fast and efficient.
- Configurability: The i3 configuration file is a simple text file that allows users to customize the behavior of the window manager extensively.
- Workspaces: i3 supports multiple virtual workspaces, where each workspace can have its own set of windows and layout.
- Scratchpad: A special area where users can temporarily store windows in a floating layer.
- IPC: i3 has a powerful inter-process communication mechanism, which allows external applications to control it and get information about the current state of windows and workspaces.

Overall, i3 is a great choice for power users who need a fast and efficient window manager that can handle multiple windows and workspaces with ease.
