Welcome to Smart LHG for the linux community

We are developing detailed documentation regarding our (lhg-works docs).
This Process and its sequence of Modular Operational System Constructs.  
Known herein as (LHG-WORKS).

Using this process as a result of a sequence model for every task and function by the host service developer.
In order to achieve a particular (HSP) method, then reusing the steps taken to achieve the desired result, 
as we develop the modules in the construction phase, we build a systematic successful implementation process 
to follow and build mutual consistencies in communications of integrity and therefore removing all rhetoric.

Thus, having documented a process and utilizing our methods to train and guide our workforce in critical matters of (sha-il docs) documentation. The purpose of these policies which resolve conflicts and thwart miss-information being passed around with no accountability. Therefore we must design a system of communicating by written formal statements, as well as documenting processes as a standard simulation of interaction. Be it Government Entities, Ministries, or otherwise.

“We must be held to account for what has been said!”

Starting with the initial phase of contact by the (HSP). Documenting the action-task process until the conclusion and providing a written report of that instance in the process.

In performing the action-task process and detailing the methods used to maintain the correct outcome. 
The desired results are in writing the scripts to perform and follow the action-task process and monitoring workloads. 
We maintain accountability throughout every action, responding to all contacts, following up messages, meeting notation minutes, Emails, etc... providing a practical means of enforcing accountability. Our job is to develop the system and scripts relating to each centralized department and structured guidelines, including operational expenses, personnel, Government Oversight, International Guidelines, Laws, and Banking rules and regulations.
