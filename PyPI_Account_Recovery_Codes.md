###PyPI_Account_Recovery_Codes.md

If you lose access to your authentication application or security key(s),
youâ€™ll need to use one of these recovery codes to log into your PyPI
account. Each code can only be used once.

These codes should only be used for account recovery, not for typical logins.

Keep these somewhere safe. If you lose your authentication application
or security key(s) and do not have access to these recovery codes, you
may permanently lose access to your PyPI account!
