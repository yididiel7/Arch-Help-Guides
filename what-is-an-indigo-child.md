In a world that has lost touch with its soul, the indigo child is here as a light-bearer, path forger, and paradigm shifter.
Although the concept of indigo children originated in the late 1960's and 1970’s, there have been groups of individuals all 
through the ages whose mission and purpose have been to awaken humanity. If you’re an old soul who feels a strong and profound 
urge to create change in society, you are likely an indigo child.
 
What is an Indigo Child?

Also referred to as a crystal or star child, an indigo child is a person who has come into this world destined to create change and spiritually awaken humanity. Indigo children are considered to be freethinkers with profound insight into the human condition and an ability to see the truth clearly. As spiritually gifted old souls, indigo children find it hard to fit into mainstream society and often become misunderstood, rejected, or misdiagnosed and medicated. The indigo child is also thought to possess strong intuition and varying spiritual gifts such as the ability to communicate with spirit guides or see visions.

## Indigo children, according to a pseudoscientific New Age concept,[1][2][3][4]

are children who are believed to possess special, unusual, and sometimes supernatural traits or abilities.[5] 
The idea is based on concepts developed in the 1970s by Nancy Ann Tappe,[6] 
who claimed to have been noticing indigo children beginning in the late 1960s.[7] 
Her ideas were further developed by Lee Carroll and Jan Tober. 

The concept of indigo children gained popular interest with the publication of a series of books 
in the late 1990s and the release of several films in the following decade. 

A variety of books, conferences, and related materials have been created surrounding belief in the idea of indigo children and their nature and abilities. 
The interpretations of these beliefs range from their being the next stage in human evolution, in some cases possessing paranormal abilities such as telepathy, 
to the belief that they are more empathetic and creative than their peers.

No scientific studies give credibility to the existence of indigo children or their traits. 
Some parents choose to label their children who have been diagnosed with learning disabilities as an indigo child to alternatively diagnose them. 
Critics view this as a way for parents to avoid considering pediatric treatment or a psychiatric diagnosis. Some lists of traits used to describe 
indigo children have also been criticized for being vague enough to be applied to most people, a form of the Forer effect.

## Abstract

In late twentieth-century America the notion of Indigo children emerged. Said to have indigo-colored auras and unique spiritual abilities, 
these young people have had difficulty fitting into social institutions and are often diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder. 
This article argues that good children turned bad through psychological illness were reinscribed as good with the aid of New Age beliefs and practices. 
These New Age components included ideas about auras, millennialism, and personal transformation.

## Synopsis

A must for the parents of unusually bright and active children!

The Indigo Child is a boy or girl who displays a new and unusual set of psychological attributes, revealing a pattern of behavior generally undocumented before. 
This pattern has singularly unique factors that call for parents and teachers to change their treatment and upbringing of these kids to assist them in achieving 
balance and harmony in their lives, and to help them avoid frustration.

In this groundbreaking book, international authors and lecturers Lee Carroll andJan Tober answer many of the often-puzzling questions surrounding Indigo Children,
such as:

· Can we really be seeing human evolution in kids today?
· Are these kids smarter than we were at their age?
· How come a lot of our children today seem to be “system busters”?
· Why are so many of our brightest kids being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)?
· Are there proven working alternatives to Ritalin?

Throughout this work, Carroll and Tober bring together some very fine minds (doctors, educators, psychologists, and more) 
who shed light on the Indigo Child phenomenon.

These children are truly special, representing a great percentage of all the kids being born today on a worldwide basis. 
They come in “knowing” who they are—so they must be recognized, celebrated for their exceptional qualities, and guided with love and care.
