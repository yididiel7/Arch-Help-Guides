# How to have a pet (cat, dog, tiger, Sakura or Tomoyo) in our Linux

[Execute oneko](http://tinyurl.com/28l3h37l).

fortune

Then they will have a tiger:

$ oneko -tora

If they execute it but with the parameter -dog then it will be a puppy:

$ oneko -dogdog


But ... those of us who are anime fans, we can have Sakura Kinomoto on our desktop with the parameter -sakura:

$ oneko -sakura

As well as Tomoyo Daidouji with the -tomoyo parameter:

$ oneko -tomoyo


We have even more options to customize our pet, here are some useful parameters:

-tofocus : It will make the pet not automatically follow our cursor, but will be "on its own" or doing whatever it wants ðŸ˜‰

-rv : It will invert the colors of the pet, for example the cat is white by default, if we apply this parameter the cat will be black.

-fg : If we do not like the color of the pet's lines, then we can simply indicate a color, for example: oneko -fg red

-bg : If we do not like our pet's skin color, we can change that color with this parameter, for example: oneko -bg red

I recommend reading the oneko (man oneko) help for more information ðŸ˜‰

Anyway, without a doubt this is a pretty funny application, it can entertain someone and show them that Linux is not that monster of white letters and black background, but that it is quite the opposite ... colorful, cheerful and may have mustaches LOL! !



A sociologist, a psychologist, and a engineer were discussing the
consequences and implications of a married man's having a mistress.  The
sociologist's opinion was that it is absolutely and categorically unforgivable
for a married man to forfeit the bond of matrimony, and engage in such lowly
and lustful pursuits.
	The psychologist's opinion was that although morally reprehensible,
if a man MUST have a mistress to achieve his full potential as a human being,
then -- well -- he may go ahead and choose to have a mistress, as long as he
is considerate enough to keep this secret from his wife.
	The engineer then interjected: "I also believe that, if necessary,
a married man is entitled to a mistress.  However, I do not see why the
affair should be concealed from the wife.  On the contrary, if the affair
is out in the open, then on Friday evenings he may tell his wife that he
is going to see his mistress, tell his mistress that he is going to be with
his wife, then go to his office and get some work done!"
